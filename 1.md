# Employee Recruiter Agent

An automated AI-powered recruitment system that streamlines the hiring process from resume screening to interview scheduling and email communications.

## Architecture

The system uses **4 specialized agents** working in a coordinated workflow:

### 1. Screening Agent

- Analyzes PDF resumes against job requirements
- Scores candidates from 0-10 based on job fit
- Provides detailed feedback on strengths and concerns
- Extracts candidate name and email
- **Output**: Structured screening results with scores and feedback


### 2. Scheduler Agent

- Creates interview appointments for qualified candidates
- Schedules meetings between 10am-6pm IST on weekdays
- Generates Zoom meeting links (simulated)
- **Output**: Interview details with date, time, and meeting URL


### 3. Email Writer Agent

- Composes professional interview invitation emails
- Includes congratulations, interview details, and next steps
- Maintains warm, professional tone
- **Output**: Email subject and body content


### 4. Email Sender Agent

- Sends invitation emails to selected candidates (simulated)
- Confirms successful delivery with details
- **Output**: Delivery confirmation


## Workflow Pipeline

```
Uploaded PDF Files + Job Description
         ↓
Phase 1: CANDIDATE SCREENING
         ├─→ Extract PDF text from uploaded files
         ├─→ Analyze against job requirements
         ├─→ Score (0-10) and provide feedback
         └─→ Filter by minimum score (default: 5.0)
         ↓
Phase 2: SELECTED CANDIDATES
         ├─→ Schedule Zoom interviews
         ├─→ Generate invitation emails
         └─→ Send emails (simulated)
         ↓
Complete Results Report
```


## Features

- **PDF Resume Processing**: Extracts text from uploaded PDF resume files
- **Intelligent Screening**: AI-powered candidate evaluation with detailed feedback
- **Automated Scheduling**: Creates interview appointments with realistic time slots
- **Professional Communications**: Generates and sends interview invitation emails
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different recruitment tasks
- **Simulated Tools**: Demo Zoom scheduling and email sending (can be replaced with real tools)
- **Configurable Threshold**: Set minimum score for candidate selection
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Upload multiple PDF files through web interface


## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash    cd 7_employee_recruiter_agent    uv pip install -e .    ```
2. **Set up your environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:
   ```    OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"    OPENROUTER_MODEL_ID="minimax/minimax-m2:free"  # Optional, defaults to minimax/minimax-m2:free    ```
3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash    streamlit run 7_employee_recruiter_agent/streamlit_app.py    ```
4. **Use the interface**:
   - Enter the job description
   - Upload PDF resume files (supports multiple files)
   - Set minimum score threshold (default: 5.0)
   - Click "Process Candidates"
5. **Test with sample resumes** (optional):
   - Sample PDF resumes are available in `sample_input/` directory
   - `john_smith_resume.pdf` - Backend engineer (should score ~7.5/10)
   - `sarah_johnson_resume.pdf` - Frontend developer (should score ~3.5/10)
   - See `sample_input/README.md` for details

## Input Format

### Resume Files

- PDF files uploaded through the web interface
- Supports multiple file uploads
- Files are temporarily stored in `tmp/uploads/`


### Job Description

- Complete job posting with requirements
- Include skills, experience, and qualifications
- The more detailed, the better the screening


### Minimum Score

- Range: 0.0 to 10.0
- Default: 5.0
- Candidates scoring below this threshold will not be selected


## Output

The system provides a comprehensive report including:

- **Summary**: Total candidates processed and selected
- **Candidate Details**: For each candidate:
  - Name and email
  - Screening score (0-10)
  - Detailed feedback
  - Selection status
  - Interview details (if selected)
  - Meeting URL (if scheduled)
  - Email status (if sent)
- **Selected Candidates Summary**: Quick list of all selected candidates


## Simulated vs Real Tools

This implementation uses **simulated** Zoom scheduling and email sending for demonstration purposes:

- **Zoom Scheduling**: Generates fake meeting URLs and times
- **Email Sending**: Logs email details without actual delivery

To use **real tools** in production:

1. Replace `simulate_zoom_scheduling` with actual Zoom API integration
2. Replace `simulate_email_sending` with SMTP or email service API
3. Add appropriate authentication and configuration

## Dependencies

- `agno>=2.2.6` - Agent framework
- `openrouter>=0.1.0` - LLM model provider
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` - Environment variable management
- `streamlit>=1.28.0` - Web UI framework
- `pypdf>=4.0.0` - PDF text extraction
- `requests>=2.31.0` - HTTP requests for PDF downloads


## Notes

- Resume processing is cached to avoid re-downloading
- All agents use structured output with Pydantic models
- Logging provides detailed progress tracking
- Error handling at each pipeline stage
- Async/await for efficient concurrent processing

# Building Multi-Agent AI Systems: My Learning Journey with Agentic AI

I’ve recently started exploring **Agentic AI** — systems where multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to complete complex, multi-step workflows. To better understand this concept, I built a **Multi-Agent Employee Recruiter** — an AI-powered system that automates candidate screening, interview scheduling, and communication.

This blog documents what I’ve learned and how you can get started.

***

## 🧠 What Are Multi-Agent Systems?

A **multi-agent AI system** is made up of several intelligent agents, each handling a specific subtask while maintaining coordination with others. The key idea is *specialization* — one agent doesn’t do everything but rather collaborates through structured inputs and outputs.

Think of it as building a team of AI coworkers: a recruiter, scheduler, email writer, and email sender, all talking to each other seamlessly.

***

## ⚙️ High-Level Architecture

Below is the conceptual flow of the Employee Recruiter Agent system:

```
Uploaded Resumes + Job Description
        ↓
 [Screening Agent] → Scores and evaluates candidates
        ↓
 [Scheduler Agent] → Books interview slots
        ↓
 [Email Writer Agent] → Crafts interview invitations
        ↓
 [Email Sender Agent] → Sends emails (simulated)
```

Each agent runs autonomously within a coordinated pipeline, passing structured data to the next.

***

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.10+**
- Basic understanding of **OpenAI/OpenRouter API** concepts
- Experience with frameworks like **Streamlit** (for UI)
- API key for your chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenRouter)

***

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

Clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
cd 7_employee_recruiter_agent
uv pip install -e .
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
OPENROUTER_MODEL_ID="minimax/minimax-m2:free"
```

Run the web interface using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run 7_employee_recruiter_agent/streamlit_app.py
```


***

## 🧩 Implementation Overview

Each agent is defined using the **Agno agent framework**, with clear Pydantic models for structured data exchange.

- **Screening Agent** – Parses PDF resumes, rates candidates, and summarizes strengths/concerns.
- **Scheduler Agent** – Generates realistic interview slots and mock Zoom links.
- **Email Writer Agent** – Creates personalized, professional invitations.
- **Email Sender Agent** – Simulates sending emails and logs results.

All agents communicate through structured JSON-like outputs, enabling easy debugging, monitoring, and future integrations (e.g., real Zoom API or SMTP server).

***

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Agentic design patterns make AI systems **modular, explainable, and scalable** — perfect for real-world automation tasks. Instead of one giant LLM prompt trying to do everything, each agent becomes a specialist.

For me, this project has been a great step in understanding not just *how* agents work, but *how they collaborate*. I plan to extend this by replacing the simulated tools with **live APIs** for end-to-end automation.

Would you like me to include a short “Next Steps” section at the end (e.g., how to extend the project with real APIs or orchestrators like LangGraph or CrewAI)?
